This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## App

Small reuasable components are in `src/Elements` more complex components are in `src/Features`.
Most logic is in `Features/transfer` which handles routing between states, and uploading to S3, so there is a single source of thruth and top-down data flow.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
